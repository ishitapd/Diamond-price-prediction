# Diamond-price-prediction
Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. Diamond pricing is crucial in the jewelry industry and having an accurate prediction model can help both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
Project Overview

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of diamonds. The steps involved in this project include:

    Data Preprocessing
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Feature Engineering
    Model Selection
    Model Training and Evaluation
    Prediction of Diamond Prices

Dataset

We are using the Diamonds dataset which contains various features related to diamond characteristics:

    Carat: The weight of the diamond.
    Cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
    Color: Diamond color grading (from D to J, where D is the best).
    Clarity: Diamond clarity (I1, SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF).
    Dimensions: Length, width, and depth of the diamond.
    Price: Price of the diamond (target variable).
